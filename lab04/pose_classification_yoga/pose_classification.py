# # Human Pose Classification with MoveNet and TensorFlow Lite
# 
# This notebook teaches you how to train a pose classification model using MoveNet and TensorFlow Lite. The result is a new TensorFlow Lite model that accepts the output from the MoveNet model as its input, and outputs a pose classification, such as the name of a yoga pose.
# 
# The procedure in this notebook consists of 3 parts:
# * Part 1: Preprocess the pose classification training data into a CSV file that specifies the landmarks (body keypoints) detected by the MoveNet model, along with the ground truth pose labels.
# * Part 2: Build and train a pose classification model that takes the landmark coordinates from the CSV file as input, and outputs the predicted labels.
# * Part 3: Convert the pose classification model to TFLite.
# 
# By default, this notebook uses an image dataset with labeled yoga poses, but we've also included a section in Part 1 where you can upload your own image dataset of poses.

# ## Preparation

# In this section, you'll import the necessary libraries and define several functions to preprocess the training images into a CSV file that contains the landmark coordinates and ground truth labels.
# 
# Nothing observable happens here, but you can expand the hidden code cells to see the implementation for some of the functions we'll be calling later on.
# 
# **If you only want to create the CSV file without knowing all the details, just run this section and proceed to Part 1.**

#@title Functions to run pose estimation with MoveNet

#@markdown You'll download the MoveNet Thunder model from [TensorFlow Hub](https://www.google.com/url?sa=D&q=https%3A%2F%2Ftfhub.dev%2Fs%3Fq%3Dmovenet), 
# and reuse some inference and visualization logic from the [MoveNet Raspberry Pi (Python)](https://github.com/tensorflow/examples/tree/master/lite/examples/pose_estimation/raspberry_pi) sample app to detect landmarks (ear, nose, wrist etc.) from the input images.

#@markdown *Note: You should use the most accurate pose estimation model (i.e. MoveNet Thunder) to detect the keypoints and use them to train the pose classification model to achieve the best accuracy. When running inference, you can use a pose estimation model of your choice (e.g. either MoveNet Lightning or Thunder).*

# ## Part 1: Preprocess the input images
# 
# Because the input for our pose classifier is the *output* landmarks from the MoveNet model, we need to generate our training dataset by running labeled images through MoveNet and then capturing all the landmark data and ground truth labels into a CSV file.
# 
# The dataset we've provided for this tutorial is a CG-generated yoga pose dataset. It contains images of multiple CG-generated models doing 5 different yoga poses. The directory is already split into a `train` dataset and a `test` dataset.
# 
# So in this section, we'll download the yoga dataset and run it through MoveNet 
# so we can capture all the landmarks into a CSV file... 
# **However, it takes about 15 minutes to feed our yoga dataset to MoveNet and generate this CSV file**. 
# So as an alternative, you can download a pre-existing CSV file for the yoga dataset 
# by setting `is_skip_step_1` parameter below to **True**. 
# That way, you'll skip this step and instead download the same CSV file that will be created in this preprocessing step.
# 
# On the other hand, if you want to train the pose classifier with your own image dataset, you need to upload your images and run this preprocessing step (leave `is_skip_step_1` **False**)—follow the instructions below to upload your own pose dataset.

# In[8]:

# ===========================================================
# -----------------------------------------------------------
# ===========================================================
is_skip_step_1 = False #@param ["False", "True"] {type:"raw"}
#is_skip_step_1 = True


# ### (Optional) Upload your own pose dataset

# In[9]:

use_custom_dataset = False #@param ["False", "True"] {type:"raw"}

dataset_is_split = False #@param ["False", "True"] {type:"raw"}


# If you want to train the pose classifier with your own labeled poses (they can be any poses, not just yoga poses), follow these steps:
# 
# 1. Set the above `use_custom_dataset` option to **True**.
# 
# 2. Prepare an archive file (ZIP, TAR, or other) that includes a folder with your images dataset. The folder must include sorted images of your poses as follows.
# 
#   If you've already split your dataset into train and test sets, then set `dataset_is_split` to **True**. That is, your images folder must include "train" and "test" directories like this:
# 
#     ```
#     yoga_poses/
#     |__ train/
#         |__ downdog/
#             |______ 00000128.jpg
#             |______ ...
#     |__ test/
#         |__ downdog/
#             |______ 00000181.jpg
#             |______ ...
#     ```
# 
#     Or, if your dataset is NOT split yet, then set
#     `dataset_is_split` to **False** and we'll split it up based
#     on a specified split fraction. That is, your uploaded images
#     folder should look like this:
# 
#     ```
#     yoga_poses/
#     |__ downdog/
#         |______ 00000128.jpg
#         |______ 00000181.jpg
#         |______ ...
#     |__ goddess/
#         |______ 00000243.jpg
#         |______ 00000306.jpg
#         |______ ...
#     ```
# 3. Click the **Files** tab on the left (folder icon) and then click **Upload to session storage** (file icon).
# 4. Select your archive file and wait until it finishes uploading before you proceed.
# 5. Edit the following code block to specify the name of your archive file and images directory. (By default, we expect a ZIP file, so you'll need to also modify that part if your archive is another format.)
# 6. Now run the rest of the notebook.

# In[10]:

#@markdown Be sure you run this cell. It's hiding the `split_into_train_test()` function that's called in the next code block.
